# Dungeon

This is a little game I created for an it-talents competition.
The assignment was to build an automatically randomly self generating labyrinth.

In doing so I used a randomised minimum spanning tree within a graph and added some random blank tiles to make it 
look more like a dungeon.
I also added some fire pits, potions to collect, and enemies (chaser and estray).

Use Dungeon.jar to start the game.
